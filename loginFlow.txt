Interview Answer (Professional Way)

“In my login flow, when a user submits their email and password, the backend first validates the inputs and checks if the user exists in the database and has verified their email.
Then it compares the password using bcrypt for secure hashing.

If the credentials are valid, I generate two JWTs — an access token (short-lived, e.g., 15 minutes) and a refresh token (long-lived, e.g., 7 days).

These tokens are sent back to the client via HTTP-only cookies using res.cookie().
This makes them inaccessible to JavaScript and helps prevent XSS attacks.

The access token is used to authorize protected routes, while the refresh token is used to generate a new access token when the old one expires.

On successful login, I return a success message and user info as JSON, but the tokens are handled through cookies automatically.

This approach ensures security and a seamless user experience — since cookies are sent automatically with every authenticated request.”

💡 Bonus Tip — If They Ask How You Handle Token Expiry

“When the access token expires, the frontend automatically hits the /refresh-token route using the refresh token cookie.
If the refresh token is still valid, the backend issues a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.
Otherwise, the user is logged out.”
